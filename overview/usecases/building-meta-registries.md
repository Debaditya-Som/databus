# Building Meta Registries

With the growing importance of the FAIR data principles and mass production of data, metadata repositories or registries that specialize in cataloguing data assets for specific domains are on the rise.&#x20;

The Databus was designed to capture metadata for every file you can imagine. It allows to easily realize a crawler or other harvesting tools that collect information spread in the Web or your intranet to make it findable and accessible at a central place.&#x20;

With the help of the Databus Mods subsystem, several custom metadata layers can be added, to facilitate a unified way to access and manage this metadata extension tailored to your specific use case. This enables to build even more complex systems like Meta-Registries that integrate or enhance heterogenous metadata catalogues from different registries in a flexible and extensible way.&#x20;
