# Usage

Build collections of datasets and files via list of URIs,
SPARQL or the graphical collection builder and insert them 
into any software or application as data dependency

Each application normally comes with small 
differences in data quality requirements, 
i.e. some need bzip2 instead of gzip,
some need other transformations. This can be automated with just
a few lines of glue code to match the application.
