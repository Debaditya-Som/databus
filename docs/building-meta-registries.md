# Building Meta Registries

With the growing importance of the FAIR data principles and mass production of data, metadata repositories or registries that specialize in cataloguing data assets for specific domains are on the rise.&#x20;

The Databus was designed to capture metadata for every file you can imagine. It allows to easily realize a crawler or other harvesting tools that collect information spread in the Web or your intranet to make it findable and accessible at a central place.&#x20;

With the help of the Databus Mods subsystem, several custom metadata layers can be added, to facilitate a unified way to access and manage this metadata extension tailored to your specific use case. This enables to build even more complex systems like meta or interoperability registries that integrate or enhance heterogeneous metadata catalogues from different registries in a flexible and extensible way.&#x20;

### Meta registry of existing files

A current problem of the data repository landscape is that these repositories which are typically focused on a specific data or research domain, have very specific, fixed metadata schemas combined with huge technical heterogeneity, which easily turn them into metadata silos, hinder findability at a larger scale and complicate the overall FAIR publishing of (research) data.

Data consumers and producers have to deal with questions like which repositories exist and which should be used to search and register data and how can they be used. Especially, for workflows from interdisciplinary domains, that employ data registered across different repositories, data access is burdensome due to this technical heterogeneity. However, the number and variety of platforms and repositories is steadily increasing, mainly driven by the paradigm “If a metadata schema or feature set of platform X is not sufficient for a use case, project or domain, typically a new, extended Platform Y which optionally integrates (parts of) platform X is developed”.&#x20;

As a consequence redundant but also complementary (different types of community-specific) metadata about the same data assets is spread apart in different repositories. The DBpedia Databus - that is based on minimal mandatory core metadata and allows metadata to be extended easily with Databus Mods - can be leveraged to discover, access and associate (meta)data for/of data assets in a unified way.&#x20;
