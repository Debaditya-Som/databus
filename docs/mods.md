# Customization, Mods, Metadata Quality


TODO Marvin:
Databus can be customized, by changing shacl, the webid and posting additional data. Please give some best practices, when to use this customization mechanism and when to use mods. I think, that if people have metadata that can not be generated from the file and is available to uploading agent, then that could be included, e.g. if they have own identifiers. Or they could limit licenses to CC or few open licenses only. Then also how do mods increase metadata quality (consistency is one aspect here, see e.g. the comments in byteSize)
